**Insights and Findings**

Based on the exploratory analysis conducted on the Titanic dataset, several key insights emerged:

**	Gender and Survival**: Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males. This aligns with the maritime protocol of "women and children first." The bar chart clearly showed survival rates among females were more than double that of males.

•	Passenger Class and Survival: First-class passengers had the highest probability of survival. Passengers in second and third class had considerably lower survival rates, indicating a class-based disparity in access to lifeboats or early evacuation.

•	Age and Survival: Children (especially under age 12) showed a higher survival rate compared to adults and seniors. This reinforces the idea that younger passengers were prioritized during evacuation efforts.

•	Fare Paid: There was a positive correlation between fare amount and survival rate. Passengers who paid higher fares (often in first class) had better survival outcomes.

•	Embarkation Port: While not a major predictor, passengers embarking from Cherbourg (C) showed slightly higher survival rates compared to those from Queenstown (Q) or Southampton (S), likely due to the class distribution of passengers embarking from each port.

•	Correlation Matrix: The heatmap indicated moderate positive correlations between survival and variables like fare and class (inverse relationship between class number and survival).

****Conclusion**

Implications:
•	Data-driven decision-making in safety planning can benefit from understanding such trends ensuring equitable evacuation plans regardless of class or gender.

•	This type of analysis also reinforces the importance of fair access to emergency resources, especially in transportation and disaster response sectors.

Future Directions:
•	A predictive machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, or random forest) could be developed using the features explored (e.g., age, sex, class) to classify survival likelihood.

•	Further feature engineering (e.g., extracting titles from names, combining family members) can be explored to improve model performance.

•	Comparison with similar maritime disasters may reveal broader patterns or validate findings.
